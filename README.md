Data Classification Project Information
You can get up to 30 points

Project are done in groups of 3 students

ðŸŽ¯ Put your name into a group in which you want to be in this Google Sheet
Every project must include description of the dataset features and a brief exploration analysis so you get to know the data you are working with

Describe your preprocessing pipeline (5 points)

ðŸ“’ Describe what operations you are performing for each of the features
e.g. No operation needed, dropping the feature, Min-Max scaling, One-hot encoding, Categorization (numeric -> categorical) etc.
You can even try to experiment with many different preprocession operations and you will see what works the best - this is totally up to you!
ðŸ”Ž What model performance metrics have you decided to use? (5 points)

e.g. Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score etc.
ðŸ“’ State which one of the scores is the most important from your point of view given the class balance, task, ... in a Markdown cell!
ðŸŽ¯ Try at least 3 different classification algorithms (15 points)

ðŸŒ³ Decision tree is a mandatory one
Other algorithm choices depends solely on you - you can find many different algorithms in the scikit-learn docs
We can recommend the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest, AdaBoost, k-Nearest Neighbors or Naive Bayes
Check blog posts, book chapters or Youtube videos about the algoritmhs you have chosen so you have a basic knowledge about its key concepts
ðŸ’¡ You know some of them already from the lectures ðŸ™‚
